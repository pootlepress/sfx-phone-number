SFX Phone Extension
================================

A simple plugin boilerplate to fast-track your Storefront extension development.

To get started: change the directory name, sfx-phone-extension.php, languages/sfx-phone-extension.po to reflect your new plugin name.

Then do some Find/Replace (case sensitive) across the entire directory:

* 'sfx-phone-extension' => 'your-extension'
* 'SFX_Phone_Extension' => 'Your_Extension'
* 'SFX Phone Extension' => 'Your Extension'
* 'sfx_phone_extension_' => 'your_extension_'
* 'sfx_px_' => 'ye_'
* 'sfxpx-' => 'ye-'

That's it! Start building!
